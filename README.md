## Rectangle Perimeter Calculator

This is a simple Python script to calculate the **perimeter of a rectangle**. The user is prompted to input the lengths of two adjacent sides (side **a** and side **b**), and the script computes and displays the perimeter using the formula :

Perimeter = 2 × (a + b)

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

No external libraries are needed.

---

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository or download the script file.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the script :

```bash
python rectangle_perimeter.py

```

5. Enter the lengths when prompted.

## How It Works

- The script uses Python’s built-in input() function to take user input.

- It calculates the perimeter using the formula 2 * (a + b).

- The result is printed to the screen.
